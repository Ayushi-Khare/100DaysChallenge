Example 1:
Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.

Example 2:
Input: word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]
Output: false
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ac" + "b" -> "acb"
word2 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
The strings are not same, so return false.

Example 3:
Input: word1  = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]
