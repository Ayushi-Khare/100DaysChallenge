Example 1:

Input: num = "6777133339"
Output: "777"
Explanation: There are two distinct good integers: "777" and "333".
"777" is the largest, so we return "777".

Example 2:

Input: num = "2300019"
Output: "000"
Explanation: "000" is the only good integer.

Example 3:

Input: num = "42352338"
Output: ""
Explanation: No substring of length 3 consists of only one unique digit. Therefore, there are no good integers.
