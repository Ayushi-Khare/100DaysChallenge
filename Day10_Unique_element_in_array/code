/*Here xor operator has been used. Xor of a number with itself is 0. 
Since in this given probelm every element will appear only 2 times and not more than that, 
use XOR operation on an element appearing twice will give the result 0. Hence it will be helpful to find the element appearing 1 once in less amount of time. */
